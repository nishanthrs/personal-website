> There was an article in Scientific American about the efficiency of locomotion of different species on the planet.
In other words, they measured how much energy it took a bird to get from point A to B, and then a fish, and goat, and so on and ranked them.
It turns out the condor won. Man came in with a rather unimpressive showing of a third of the way down the list.
But someone had the insight to measure the efficiency of man riding a bicycle.
And man riding a bicyle was twice as good as the condor! And what it illustrated is man's ability as a toolmaker to fashion a tool that can amplify an inherent ability that he has.

## Tool Builders

When we think about humans compared to other living things, our bodies are inherently inferior to many of them.
We're not the fastest, we're not the biggest, we're not the strongest. On top of all that, our five senses pale in comparison to that of many other living things.
However, we reside at the apex. And the single biggest reason for that is that **we're pretty damn good at building tools that augment our capabilities.**

We have built some amazing tools throughout history to amplify our abilities, making us incredibly advanced and powerful. Just a brief overview:
  * **Shelter:** clothing, heaters, air conditioners, bulldozers
  * **Food:** tractors, fertilizers, irrigation, gas stoves, microwaves
  * **Transportation:** bicycle, boats, cars, planes, jets, rockets
  * **Communication:** language, money, paper, printing press, telegraph, telephone, camera, computers, internet, smartphones
  * **Physical power:** spears, swords, guns, tanks, bombs, missiles, drones

These tools greatly augment fundamental human behaviors and abilities to incredibly high magnitudes.
Just like our ancestors, we have the same five senses and two arms and two legs.
But with these tools, those same bodies can now achieve things our ancestors couldn't even dream of.
There's another word for this amplifiction of our abilities: progress.

History has taught us that humans will continue to discover new truths and build new tools in spite of how dangerous they may be.
These tools are not always built because they are useful or will benefit the state of humankind, *but because they can be built* (what benefit do nuclear weapons have)?
Simply put, progress is inevitable. Given this, what kind of future awaits us?

## The Current Landscape

**You are already a [cyborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg).**

Take smartphones. Smartphones are one of the most incredible tools we've ever built as humans. Think about how you use it:
* You can talk to your parents and siblings and friends all the time no matter where you are.
* You have access to all the information humanity has ever found at your fingertips. Any new information can show up on your phone in seconds.
* You can order whatever you want and have it delivered to the comfort of your own home.

As a result, you've become incredibly dependent on this small rectangular box.
If you lose it, you wouldn't be able to do much of anything. What limited things you can do would take hundreds of times longer.

But no one can fault you for becoming so dependent on them. They enhance what you can do so much. Why the hell would you not use it?
If you don't have a smartphone, you are much more limited in what you can do than others.
At this point, it's more or less a part of you; a second brain.

A cyborg is a being with both organic and biomechatronics body parts.
When so much of your life is dependent on this electronic device, the insistence that you're not a cyborg doesn't sound very convincing anymore.
We're more machine than we think.

## The Merge

Given that we recognize how useful this invention has been in enhancing our capabilities and how historically progress has been inevitable,
the next step functions of progress will be to integrate these devices deeper into ourselves. You can imagine this already with emerging computing platforms:
* Smartwatches
  * They track important metrics on our health and give us useful information on our physical abilities.
  * In the future, as its capabilities expand, it will become a near necessity to have one. Doctors will use the data to offer more refined and personalized treatments.
  It's no secret that this is also part of [Apple's ambitions to further capture you in its ecosystem and become a healthcare company](https://archive.ph/JOmTG).
* Smartglasses (augmented reality)
  * For now, they're just cute. They play music and take photos and videos. The value proposition over doing the same thing with smartphones is shaky.
  * Imagine them with argumented reality. You can see how you look in new clothes, view different furnishings in the apartment, and
  * Imagine them further augmented by AI. It can become a more integrated digital assistant that can give you step-by-step instructions on fixing your bike or identify the exact nutrients of your meals.

With the explosion of breakthroughs in recent years with AI models, GPUs, and smaller and more powerful chips, there's a high chance that these devices become this powerful.
If these companies are successfully able to augment our capabilities like this with a great user experience, these devices will become more embedded into our bodies.

If we project to the very far future, we may find ourselves bringing even more radical ideas to life to level up ourselves even more:
* Uploading our brains to an android body where it can live even after our body decays and dies (TODO: Altered Carbon link)
* [Uploading our brains to the cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(TV_series)), effectively achieving immortality
* Enhancing our physical bodies with X-ray vision or artillery or , [like in cyberpunk dystopias]()

I'm not here to tell you whether this is a future we should want or not. I do however believe that there's a strong case for it being inevitable.
If we don't, we will fall behind other people who embed the technology within themselves and become smarter and more powerful.
If AI continues to be worked on, we may even fall behind an AI. If we want to remain at the top or prevent it from replacing us, we will have to enhance ourselves even more with technology.
All of these developments will cause us to start to wonder: what does it truly mean to be a human?

At that point, the merge between life and technology will be complete.
