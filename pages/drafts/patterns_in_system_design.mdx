This post will be about recognizing patterns in the design of multiple scalable systems.
Given specific functional or non-functional requirements in the design of the system, which components
do you use or integrate into the system to solve for those requirements?
The purpose is to see the designs of multiple systems from a higher level instead of learning the design
of multiple systems isolated from each other.

Structure:
* Intro about purpose and usefulness of seeing patterns in system design
  * Ex. "There are many software products out there that work incredibly seamlessly at mind-boggling scales. <Cite some statistics here.>
  Understanding its building blocks and how they're designed not only satisfies my innate level of curiosity,
  but also gives me tools to understand how I would build something of my own and consequently,
  gives me a lot of agency, power, and freedom."
  "DISCLAIMER: This post is meant for people with some level of expertise in computer science and programming."
* Bullet point list of high-level design patterns:
  * Functional/non-functional requirement
  * Component in system design that solves for it and how
  * Example systems that use this
* Bullet point list of lower-level deep dives and follow-ups:
  * Potential problem/bottleneck
  * How to solve for it
  * Problems can be about distributed systems (compute AND storage), how to scale various aspects of system,
  bursts of traffic, database schemas,
* Mention what's not covered
* Experiment with different animations via 3Blue1Brown Manim lib
