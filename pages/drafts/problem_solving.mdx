  Yes, this experiment seems to work, this appears to be a fact; but how can people discover such facts?
  And how could I invent or discover such things by myself?

  Confronting the Unknown
</h2>
I read all the time about how people make startling and interesting discoveries in the realm of mathematics, science, and even business:
* Richard Feynman derived new groundbreaking ideas in quantum electrodynamics from [simply trying to understand the wobble rate of a plate](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html).
* Bob Noyce revolutionized tech economics by [selling integrated circuits for less than a dollar](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-relentless-jeff-bezos/#:~:text=The%20first%20tech%20CEO%20to%20truly%20grasp%20how%20tech%20economics%20were%20different%20from%20most%20other%20businesses%20was%20Bob%20Noyce%20(the%20future%20Intel%20founder)%20at%20Fairchild%20Semiconductor.) because he realized that software has zero material costs, making the best route to profitability through volume.
* Jeff Bezos took the concept of tech economics and a product flywheel and created [his own flywheel for the Amazon retail business](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BezosNapkinSketch.png),
becoming one of the most successful business strategies ever.

I've realized that **I'm unable to make these kinds of leaps in thinking in order to come up with out-of-the-box solutions that no one else can.**
When I'm faced with unknown or seemingly insurmountable problems, I take a defeatist approach: I give up, thinking it's impossible to solve or that I'll never get the solution.
And then I just look up the solution, understand it, and memorize it for next time.

**The only way to expand one's abilities of learning and problem-solving is to learn how to discover and build solutions yourself rather than simply understand them.**
Discovering the solutions to interesting problems yourself also creates a sense of pure joy and triumph that simply reading and understanding the solution could never.

  The Problem with Learning in Schools
</h2>
This skill of solving problems through discovery is rarely taught in schools and only in some higher education programs.
This is an idea that's been pointed out by a lot of famous educators like [Po-Shen Loh](https://www.poshenloh.com/), [Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown)](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), and [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman).
We are usually taught a class of problems, a formula on how to solve them, and the solution.

But in this kind of approach, we are not taught how to break down a more complex problem into a set of simple problems.
We are not taught how to take an ambiguous problem and identify what class or type of problem it is.
We are not taught *how or why* a given approach or solution works for a specific set of problems.
We are not taught why a formula exists or how it makes sense.
And we are most certainly not taught *how* to discover such solutions ourselves.
**I may know how to compute any kind of integral, but what good is this knowledge if when I'm given a real-world problem, I can't identify when or how I have to use this technique to get the answer?**

A students' understanding AND motivation are greatly increased if they are given real-life problems that force them to:
  * Break the problem down into multiple pieces.
  * Apply fundamental concepts to solve each of those pieces.
  * Stitch each of these solutions together to build the final solution.
Many education programs don't quite teach us how to make that next step of learning how to break a problem down into simpler pieces and create the solution ourselves.

// TODO: How to create a blockquote component similar to Stratechery?

A common and reasonable rebuttal to this is that trying to establish complete ownership over a concept by discovering it yourself is very time-consuming.
It's true that you can't possibly keep up with all the course material in a math or science course if you force yourself to derive every possible theorem and formula.
However, this rebuttal focuses more on the skill of *deriving a concept versus understanding its purpose.*
Deriving or proving a concept is the most thorough and hardcore way to building this muscle of problem solving.
But you certainly don't have to derive every new concept you learn. Time is finite, so there is a point in which you have to just accept the fundamentals as it is.
The importance lies more in *how well you understand the concept from top to bottom* so that given a complex and ambiguous problem, you know exactly if, how, and when to apply it.

  How to Discover Solutions Rather than Understand
</h2>
Contrary to many people's thoughts, solving tough problems or coming up with creative solutions doesn't usually require extremely complex or technical ideas.
Instead, these problems are solved in a multitude of other ways:
* Problem Identification: mapping another similar problem or subproblem to the current problem and adapting the solution accordingly (form of intuitive thinking)
* Inductive Reasoning: breaking up the problem into multiple subproblems and constructing the final solution via solutions to these subproblems
* Building Connections: forming interesting connections between multiple fundamental ideas
  * *In other words, the building blocks are simple, but the connections you make between these blocks to incrementally build a solution are extremely important.*

Given this, I believe there are a few ways to make this leap in thinking and become an extremely adept problem solver:
* Practice looking at completely unknown problems and identifying what class or type of problems they are and what techniques or algorithms could solve them.
* Learn the building blocks/fundamentals extremely well. It should be **second-nature** to understand, explain, and implement them.
  * [Spaced repetition](https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition) helps a lot with retention of these concepts.
* Learn how to make the connections between these building blocks to incrementally build solutions to more complex problems. In other words, strengthen your capabilities in inductive reasoning.
* Practice unknown problems constantly and really struggle with them (a couple hours/problem) before looking up or understanding the solution.
  * *This persistence is really important since the brain won't build these connections without some stress and struggle.*
  * *Problem-solving is not a spectator sport.* The only way to get better at solving problems is to actually solve problems!
* Be able to articulate the solutions to these problems very clearly and concisely out loud.
After listening to your explanation, a person outside your field should be able to understand how the solution works.
This is inspired by the [Feynman technique](https://todoist.com/inspiration/feynman-technique).

// TODO: Rephrase this to emphasize problem identification and fundamental understanding over derivation.

Over the course of high school, college, and the first couple years of work, I discarded the value of thinking deeply and deriving solutions to problems.
I thought it was far more efficient to simply learn what I needed to know, apply it to what I do, and get the best grade I can.
After all, someone else already solved it and trying to discover the solution myself is just a waste of time.

// TODO: Elaborate on doing things for yourself and intrinsic joy and not for external factors.

**But I now realize the most efficient approach is not always the best approach.**
Somewhere along the way, I forgot about the joy of curiosity, figuring out something for yourself, and toying around or experimenting with a challenging problem.
Everything in my life just became all about the external objective: better grades, a good job, moving on to the next thing.
The time-consuming and sometimes painful process of learning how to discover and build solutions on my own is incredibly valuable, even if the problem has already previously been solved by millions of other people.
Doing this over and over prepares me to identify and solve tougher problems in the future and come up with inventive solutions that few others can.
Plus, there's no better intrinsic feeling when you can deconstruct a complex problem or concept, learn why it works from first principles, and apply that skill of reasoning to solve tough problems.
It's far more rewarding compared to simply recalling a previous solution. I want to rediscover that joy.
