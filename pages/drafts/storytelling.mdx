### Power of Stories
"I think becoming a lawyer was largely what drove me to the conclusion that
good stories matter more than good institutions. It was shocking to me at first
how important storytelling is in the law: not just in the form of stories lawyers
weave for juries and judges, but in the way the profession conceives of itself
and tells itself stories to valorize certain arguments and to dismiss others,
to justify systematic oppression and violence, to rationalize away the intolerable.
It fundamentally changed the way I think about stories and how they are the software of society."

### Purpose of Stories

Objective of sci-fi is not to predict what the future will look like.
The future is impossible to predict due to the myriad amount of factors, variables, unknown unknowns, and second-order+ degree effects an action can have.
It is quite literally impossible to do so.
But the story doesn't have to do that; a good approximation based on a reasonable extrapolation of current trends is ok.
Even bringing a totally impossible and unproven technology into the story is totally fine!
(Ken Liu often uses unmaterialized patents as inspirations for technology to use in his stories)
The true purpose of sci-fi is to define a set of concepts and metaphors to help you think about technology and its possible effects on human nature and society.
Ex. 1984 defined concepts and phrases like "big brother", "doublethink", "thoughtcrime", "newspeak" to help us think about the danger of
powerful governments and the abuse of technological tools and propaganda and eradication of history to control and mindhack people.
It tells stories of change and how to craft the future. You come out of sci-fi stories with ways of thinking and talking about
things/tools that haven't been invented yet, envisioning things that haven't existed, and how to guide and mold the world into a future state you want it.
"The fact that the world didn't become like the one in 1984 is a triumph of that vision. Because the vocabulary of 1984 became so pervasive and so all-consuming that governments and citizens were on guard against it." -- Ken Liu
The pace of change is incredibly fast. As the world changes, we need to learn new stories, new ways of storytelling, new vocabularies for these changes.
Because as a species, we humans don't know how to understand the world except through stories.

### Components of a Good Story Idea:
* Villain with very compelling ideas
  * Makes the story more ambiguous and polarizing and entertaining, creates tension on both sides of conflict, creates opportunity for more discussion
  * Can be anything: outside character, ideology, the self, etc.
* Hero must go through a lot of suffering
  * Victories must feel earned, a lot of conflicts in life are hard so we gravitate towards something where a character
  goes through a lot of struggle b/c it may illuminate a path forward for ourselves
  * The suffering must also be as dramatic as possible and connect to the audience in some way (to allow them to empathize)
  * AoT a great example of this; any war story in general
* Interesting Nature of Conflict
  * Conflict of self, interesting ideology clashes
    * Nationalism vs globalism (AoT)
    * Is utilitarianism actually good (AoT)
    * Could a tech oracle that predicts human behavior and crime actually create a utopian society (Psycho-Pass, The Regular)
    * What does it mean to be human? What % of your body is Android? (Cyberpunk) Would you upload yourself? (Pantheon)
    * Power and destructive nature of ego, pride, your inner shadow (Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Berserk)
    * The past haunting you and living with regret (Mad Men, Berserk, Mr. Robot, Cowboy Bebop, Remains of the Day)
    * Perils of capitalism (Brief History of Trans-pacific Tunnel) and hacker culture revolution (Mr. Robot)
    * Power of all-encompassing and dictator government (1984)
    * What does it really mean to be happy? Is it the lack of stress and utilitarianism? Is such a world actually a utopia? (Brave New World, Psycho-Pass, American Beauty)
    * Staying true to your roots, treasuring your relationships (Paper Menagerie)
    * What does it mean to have individualism? Is it weaker or stronger than other ways of living? Is there a stronger form or new perspective of it? (Mono no Aware)
    * Is it a good thing to relive history? What are its implications? ()
    * Adapting to the times, impermanence and death, cyclical nature of humanity (Good Hunting)
  * Many sides and factions involved in the conflict (Social Network, Mr. Robot, AoT at the end)
* Growth and dynamism in characters (Ping Pong, Mad Men are stories with amazing characters)
  * Wide array of personalities and contribute to the conflict in interesting ways
  * Seemingly good but a dark side (Death Note: L fights on the good side, but is selfish and only in it for the thrill)
  * Mix of static and dynamic characters (but mostly dynamic)
    * Most interesting is having these aspects in one character (AoT: Eren changes a lot throughout the series, but the goal for freedom remains the same and is twisted in the most interesting and dark way)
  * Grow after experiencing suffering, struggles, challenges and confronting limitations
  * Humor (sarcasm)
* Must have dramatic aspects
  * Examples are an atomic bomb project, use of weapons and violence, huge scales, etc.
  * Many scientific pursuits are world-changing, but only some have enough dramatic elements to be made into a story or movie
    * Ex. Oppenheimer can be made into a movie b/c the conflicts (WWII, morality within Oppenheimer, courtroom drama) are all hugely dramatic,
    whereas invention of transistor, while just as revolutionary, does not have nearly as many interesting struggles and conflicts
    * Ex. Social Network was made exciting b/c of diff factions all competing for the same billion dollar idea: social networking, the control of human behavior online
* Create multiple threads of suspense
  * Quite simple; creates a binge behavior where audience wants to find out what happens (cliffhangers)
  * Suspense can be created within both plot elements and character behaviors (keep audience guessing on what they're going to do next)
  * AoT is a master of this and foreshadowing
* Rollercoaster of evoking emotions
* Interesting or fantastical element
  * Can be expressed as literalizations/metaphors of real things
    * Pretty much all of Ken Liu's short stories in Paper Menagerie
    * Superpowers in The Boys that are behaviors of teenage girls (Marie cutting herself -- suicide, Emma throwing up -- anorexia)
    * Killer notebook in Death Note
* Worldbuilding
  * Creates stronger sense of immersion and thus a more powerful effect on the reader

Not all stories have to have all these elements. But each of these elements can be used in conjunction with each other to craft a very powerful narrative.
"The human mind is really good at making associations between things that are otherwise unrelated. The more you can do that, the more original your ideas will be." -- Ken Liu
