Hey, I'm Nishanth!

Yes, I work in tech. Yes, I work in FAANG. No, I don't wear Allbirds.

Why do I have a website? Because I want to own a digital space where I can:
   * *Write down my experiences*
   * *Articulate all the swirling thoughts I have*
   * *Show the projects (if any) that I work on*

I'm a huge advocate of the concept that **you don't really remember or know something unless you can write about it concisely and clearly.**
What better way to remember what I learn and experience than writing it down here?
Of course, I'm also hoping that someone out there will not only read what I write (*wouldn't that be amazing?*), but also learn something new and interesting from it.
