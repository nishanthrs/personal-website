"Modern nation states cannot ask people to die anymore, for a king or glory or whatever.
Modern nation states ask people to die for a story, for an ideal. The reason why we're asked to die all the time
by nation states is for a story, a collective story that we all believe in, that we think is worth it.
It's not pros and cons, it's not economic analysis; ultimately when you ask people to make these great sacrifices, they have to believe in the story."

and how it relates to your own life (way to empathize with the reader and make this post important to them)

I've recently been thinking a lot about why some people are so effective at building teams,
getting people excited, and inspiring many people to achieve the impossible. What makes them so magnetic
and charismatic? What about them makes people want to follow them into such a daunting task?

**It's their ability to tell stories.**

Humans are incredibly good tool-builders. Stories may, in fact, be the most powerful tool we've ever created.

## The Power of Stories

Stories are incredibly important in helping us make sense of the world and ourselves. So much so that when an
event occurs, we can't make sense of it unless it fits neatly into a narrative. Often, the universe seems like
nothing more than one meaningless random event after another. To live in such an unfeeling entity seems so bleak
and incomprehensible that we try to explain reality as a linear chain of cause and effect events.
Anything that doesn't go with or fit and interesting story or people's preconceived narratives will be ignored and forgotten.
However, this narrative fallacy simplifies and lossily compresses the actual truth. Those well-constructed plots
and satisfying character arcs make it so enticing to believe in, but ultimately, these stories often can't be used
to seek truth or predict the future.

However, it's important to note that just because stories aren't a 1:1 representation of reality, it doesn't mean
that stories aren't important or don't touch upon some aspect of the truth.

**Stories are the essence of memory, inspiration, and action.**

Well-constructed plots are great tools to immerse you in another world, force you to reckon with difficult decisions,
and help you learn more about yourself, your values, and how you want to live your life. Reading *1984* forced
many people to grapple with the implications of an all-powerful government and question if they fell into groupthink
in their own lives. *Brave New World* changed many people's perspectives of what a true utopia is and what happiness
actually means to them. Science fiction stories often focus on a new piece of technology and force people to grapple
with what a future with this technology looks like and how we should interact with it.

Character arcs: their interactions with others, struggles, and decisions help us learn more about ourselves
and why we and others can act in certain ways. *Mad Men* shows how heavily people can be affected by their pasts
and all the self-destructive ways that they try to deal with it. *Breaking Bad* shows how noble intentions can
devolve into terrible actions due to underlying and repressed desires. Heartbreaking memoirs of soldiers illustrate
not only how terrible war can be, but also how people can either overcome such hopeless situations or become
damaged for life. Such stories help us empathize with others and understand more about ourselves so that we can
live better lives.

Stories also satiate our need for heroism. <TODO: Insert quote about need for heroism> Many of them weave together these tales of bravery, struggle, and courage
of epic proportions. We live vicariously through the characters in these stories, we're inspired by the worlds they
create and the choices they make, and those stories ultimately shape and form our own actions, aspirations, and dreams.
Stories can become self-fulfilling prophecies; the fact that we believe in them can be enough to make it true.
*They are the software of our society.*

## Stories Are Everywhere

You may not have noticed it, but stories are quite literally everywhere:
* Religious texts such as the Bible and Bhagavad Gita espouse important philosophies and move people through
numerous epic tales and stories.
* Leaders of state and government craft narratives about other countries and deploy them as propaganda to rally
a nation to war.
* Companies put together big mission statements to give their employees a noble purpose in their work and enhance
their productivity.
* Conspiracy theories are an attempt by people to explain the unknown. We cannot stand not knowing something
and in doing so, we'll guess at what the truth is, no matter how little evidence there is or far away from
the actual truth it is. Because not knowing means no control, and that is a far more terrifying prospect.
* Science fiction stories are commonly cited as many technologists' and companies' inspirations for creating a
set of technologies.
* Sports networks and leagues create and manufacture storylines all the time. Two teams being pitted against each other
are often framed as a version of David v. Goliath, a player's story is framed many times as a rags to riches story, and
hidden connections between players and coaches of opposite teams are shown as history coming full circle.
These stories give us something to cheer for and inspire us, significantly increasing the amount of people tuning
in and engaging with the sport.

Stories are the most powerful and prevalent tool we have at our disposal. They can galvanize action and shape humanity
and our actions like nothing else. They help us make sense of this unfeeling universe and ourselves and other people.
However, they are imprecise in seeking truth and predicting the future. They can also be used to inspire people to do
terrible things. How we live out the rest of our lives and our futures is dependent on the stories we tell to each other.
