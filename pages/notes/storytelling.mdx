"Modern nation states cannot ask people to die anymore, for a king or glory or whatever.
Modern nation states ask people to die for a story, for an ideal. The reason why we're asked to die all the time
by nation states is for a story, a collective story that we all believe in, that we think is worth it.
It's not pros and cons, it's not economic analysis; ultimately when you ask people to make these great sacrifices, they have to believe in the story."

## The Power of Stories

* Introduce why you were thinking about this topic; some specific and abstract questions
and how it relates to your own life (way to empathize with the reader and make this post important to them)
* Outline the power and importance of stories in society and for humanity
  * Ideas presented in stories transport you to another world and force you to reckon with
  how you would live, what choices you would make in such a world, consequences of a fantastical element
    * 1984
    * Brave New World
    * Sci-fi stories
  * Character interactions and struggles and choices show what philosophies are there, what choices
  are available to you, how to make decisions from many diff perspectives, allow you to live vicariously through them
    * Mad Men
    * Breaking Bad
    * War stories of soldiers
  * Power of narratives in inspiring action, creating lasting memories
  * Gives you a framework on how to live your life and make decisions
  * Satiates man's need for heroism (Szilard quote from "Making of the Atomic Bomb")
  * Anything that doesn't go with or fit an interesting story or people's preconceived narratives will be ignored

Humans are incredibly good tool-builders. Stories may, in fact, be the most powerful tool we've ever created.

## Stories Are Everywhere

* Cite specific examples
  * Religious texts (Bible, Bhagavad Gita)
  * War; propaganda (WW2, China)
  * Company missions
  * Pandemic; conspiracy theories
  * Sci-fi inspiration for technologists
  * Sports (NBA and NFL manufacture storylines constantly)
